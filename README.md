# Ahegao Discord Bot
**Ahegao** is the bot I made for my discord server. I have just started to learn Golang so this will be an ongoing project as I learn more about the language.

This requires [discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) and **[Anpan](https://github.com/MikeModder/anpan/)** to work. <br>
This bot is roughly based off **[Anpan](https://github.com/MikeModder/anpan/)** too.

## Usage
Check the `example` directory for an example of the .json config files. <br>
These config files go in `1.` by default. <br>
To run `cd` to `./` and execute `go run .`.
